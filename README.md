# MethaBac-code
Code for working with Methanobacteria genomes

Currently, a ```.txt``` file contains the commands I used for trimming and alignment of new MySeq reads to the genomes from NCBI, and a ```.sh``` file is a shell (bash) script abstracting the same commands.
Actually, I created it mainly to learn how to use named arguments in bash scripts :)

```spades-align-with-scaffolds.sh``` script contains commands used for a de-novo assembly with spades (with the assistance of the preexisted scaffolds).
